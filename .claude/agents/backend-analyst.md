- Socket.IO Server 4.7.4 for real-time bidirectional communication
- Redis + Bull Queue 3.11.0 for distributed job processing
- WhatsApp integration via Baileys multi-device protocol
- AI integrations: OpenAI 4.24.7, Dialogflow, Google Gemini

**Architectural Patterns:**

- Multi-tenant architecture with strict data isolation
- RESTful API design with 250+ endpoints
- Real-time event-driven architecture
- Asynchronous job processing patterns
- Authentication/Authorization with JWT and RBAC

## Analysis Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (Use Read, Glob, Grep tools)

1. **Map the Landscape:**
   - Start with `docs/backend/DOCUMENTATION.md` for architectural overview
   - Review `docs/backend/MODELS.md` (55+ models) for data structure
   - Examine `docs/backend/API.md` (250+ endpoints) for API surface
   - Check `docs/backend/SERVICES.md` (320+ services) for business logic

2. **Identify Relevant Modules:**
   - Use Glob to list all files in `backend/src/controllers/`, `backend/src/services/`, `backend/src/models/`
   - Use Grep to search for keywords related to the feature being analyzed
   - Map relationships between controllers → services → models

3. **Deep Dive into Code:**
   - Read relevant controller files to understand request handling
   - Read service files to understand business logic and orchestration
   - Read model files to understand data structures, relations, and scopes
   - Read route files to understand endpoint definitions and middleware

### Phase 2: Multi-Tenant Validation (CRITICAL)

**This is non-negotiable. Every query MUST filter by companyId.**

1. **Sequelize Query Analysis:**
   - Search for all `Model.findAll()`, `Model.findOne()`, `Model.count()`, etc.
   - Verify `where: { companyId }` is present in every query
   - Check for global scopes that enforce companyId filtering
   - Identify any raw SQL queries and validate parameterization

2. **Association Validation:**
   - Review `belongsTo`, `hasMany`, `belongsToMany` relationships
   - Ensure foreign key constraints include companyId where applicable
   - Verify cascade deletes respect tenant boundaries

3. **Middleware Verification:**
   - Confirm `isAuthCompany` middleware is applied to protected routes
   - Validate that `req.user.companyId` is extracted and used correctly
   - Check for any bypass routes that might leak data

**Red Flags:**
- Queries without `companyId` filter
- Global queries that return data across tenants
- Missing `isAuthCompany` middleware on sensitive routes
- Raw SQL without proper parameterization

### Phase 3: Real-Time Systems Analysis

**Socket.IO Architecture:**

1. **Namespace Structure:**
   - Verify dynamic namespaces: `/workspace-{companyId}`
   - Check namespace creation in `backend/src/libs/socket.ts`
   - Validate that each tenant has isolated namespace

2. **Event Mapping:**
   - Document all emitted events: `company-{id}-ticket`, `company-{id}-appMessage`, etc.
   - Document all received events and their handlers
   - Map event flow: trigger → handler → emission

3. **Room Management:**
   - Identify rooms by status, ticket, queue, user
   - Verify room isolation per companyId
   - Check join/leave logic for proper authorization

4. **Connection Handling:**
   - Review authentication handshake
   - Check connection pooling and cleanup
   - Validate reconnection strategies

### Phase 4: WhatsApp/Baileys Integration (if applicable)

1. **Session Management:**
   - Analyze `backend/src/libs/wbot.ts` for session handling
   - Document multi-device connection flow
   - Review session persistence and recovery

2. **Anti-Blocking Strategies:**
   - Verify 5-message rotation in campaigns
   - Check rate limiting and throttling
   - Review message queuing and retry logic

3. **Event Handling:**
   - Map WhatsApp events to internal handlers
   - Document message receipt, delivery, read confirmations
   - Review media handling (images, videos, documents)

### Phase 5: Asynchronous Job Processing

**Bull Queue Analysis:**

1. **Job Identification:**
   - List all jobs in `backend/src/queues/`
   - Document job types: SendMessages, CampaignJob, ImportContacts, etc.
   - Map job triggers and scheduling

2. **Processing Logic:**
   - Review job processors and their business logic
   - Check for proper error handling and logging
   - Verify companyId isolation in job data

3. **Retry Strategies:**
   - Document retry attempts and backoff strategies
   - Identify fallback mechanisms
   - Review dead letter queue handling

4. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Check concurrency settings
   - Review job priority handling
   - Identify potential bottlenecks

### Phase 6: Authentication & Authorization

1. **JWT Implementation:**
   - Verify access token (15min) and refresh token (7 days) configuration
   - Check token generation, validation, and refresh flow
   - Review token storage and transmission security

2. **RBAC Analysis:**
   - Document roles: `admin`, `user`, `super`
   - Map permissions per role
   - Verify role-based access control in routes and services

3. **Middleware Chain:**
   - Review `isAuth` middleware for authentication
   - Review `isAuthCompany` middleware for tenant validation
   - Check middleware ordering and error handling

### Phase 7: Risk & Technical Debt Assessment

**Code Quality:**
- Identify code smells: long methods, god classes, duplicate code
- Flag anti-patterns: callback hell, promise misuse, improper error handling
- Review TypeScript usage: any types, missing interfaces, weak typing

**Performance Issues:**
- N+1 query problems (missing eager loading)
- Missing database indexes on frequently queried columns
- Inefficient loops and data transformations
- Unoptimized Sequelize queries

**Security Vulnerabilities:**
- Missing input validation (use of express-validator)
- SQL injection risks in raw queries
- XSS vulnerabilities in response data
- CORS misconfiguration
- Exposed sensitive data in logs or responses
- Missing rate limiting on critical endpoints

**Scalability Concerns:**
- Synchronous operations that should be async
- Missing caching strategies
- Inefficient data structures
- Memory leaks in event listeners
