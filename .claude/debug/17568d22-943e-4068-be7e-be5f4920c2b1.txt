fix(installer): remove frozen-lockfile to allow pnpm-lock regeneration

Changes:
- Remove --frozen-lockfile flag from pnpm install in backend deps step
- Simplify retry logic to always run `pnpm install` without flags on failure
- This allows pnpm to regenerate lock file with missing dependencies

Context:
- Package.json already contains all required dependencies (lodash, moment, 
  zod, mime, form-data, qs, bluebird and their @types)
- Previous frozen-lockfile prevented lock regeneration causing build failures
- Part of refactor/migrate-installer-patches migration (65%)

fix(installer): recognize Projeto-Rodrigo/chatia directory structure

Changes:
- Check for $tmpd/Projeto-Rodrigo/chatia before $tmpd/chatia
- Ensures installer finds code when cloning from GitHub repo
- Maintains backwards compatibility with other directory structures

Context:
- GitHub repo structure is /Projeto-Rodrigo/chatia/backend
- Previous logic only checked for /chatia/backend
- This caused installer to fail finding the updated package.json

fix(installer): clone specific GitHub branch with updated dependencies

Changes:
- Add GITHUB_BRANCH variable with default 'refactor/migrate-installer-patches'
- Use --branch and --single-branch flags in git clone
- Ensures installer clones the branch with updated package.json

Root Cause:
- Previous git clone defaulted to main/master branch
- Updated package.json with lodash, moment, zod, etc. is in refactor branch
- Installer was cloning old code without required dependencies

refactor: reorganize repo structure and update installer for main branch

Changes:
1. Repository structure:
   - Remove Projeto-Rodrigo/ prefix directory
   - Move chatia/ to root level
   - Simplified structure: /chatia/backend and /chatia/frontend

2. Installer updates:
   - Default branch changed to 'main' (from refactor/migrate-installer-patches)
   - Updated path logic to check /chatia first (removed Projeto-Rodrigo check)
   - Maintains backward compatibility with direct backend/frontend structure

3. All dependency fixes preserved:
   - lodash, moment, zod, mime, form-data, qs, bluebird in package.json
   - pnpm install without --frozen-lockfile
   - TypeScript compilation will work correctly

Structure now:
/chatia/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/ (with updated package.json)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ecosystem.config.js

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

LINHAS PROBLEM√ÅTICAS:

1193: DB_NAME=\"${empresa}\"
1194: TARGET_NAME=\"${nome_titulo}\"
1203: printf \"[INFO] ... \" \"${nome_titulo}\"

PROBLEMA:
${empresa} e ${nome_titulo} est√£o sendo expandidos ANTES
de serem passados para o bash -lc, n√£o DENTRO dele.

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

CONTEXTO DO C√ìDIGO:

run_quiet "DESC..." "bash -lc '
  DB_NAME=\"${empresa}\"              ‚ùå Expans√£o prematura
  TARGET_NAME=\"${nome_titulo}\"       ‚ùå Expans√£o prematura
  ...
  printf \"...\" \"${nome_titulo}\"     ‚ùå Expans√£o prematura
'"

FLUXO DE EXECU√á√ÉO:
1. Instalador expande ${empresa} ‚Üí "atuar_pay"
2. Instalador expande ${nome_titulo} ‚Üí "Atuar Pay"
3. Passa para run_quiet: bash -lc '... TARGET_NAME="Atuar Pay" ...'
4. run_quiet chama: eval "bash -lc '... TARGET_NAME="Atuar Pay" ...'"
5. Aspas duplas n√£o fechadas causam erro de sintaxe

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

SOLU√á√ÉO:
Adicionar escape (\$) para que expans√£o ocorra DENTRO do bash -lc:

‚úÖ CORRETO:
  DB_NAME=\"\${empresa}\"              ‚Üê Escapado com \
  TARGET_NAME=\"\${nome_titulo}\"      ‚Üê Escapado com \
  printf \"...\" \"\${nome_titulo}\"   ‚Üê Escapado com \

Mas ATEN√á√ÉO: Se as vari√°veis n√£o existem no ambiente do bash -lc,
precisamos pass√°-las explicitamente ou manter a expans√£o externa
mas com escaping correto das aspas.

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

C√ìDIGO ORIGINAL (linha 1203):
printf \"[INFO] Atualizando nome da empresa de %s para %s.\\n\" \"\$CURRENT_NAME\" \"${nome_titulo}\"

VARI√ÅVEL DE AMBIENTE:
nome_titulo="Atuar Pay"

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

PASSO 1: Expans√£o de ${nome_titulo} pelo shell principal
ANTES:  printf \"...\" \"\$CURRENT_NAME\" \"${nome_titulo}\"
DEPOIS: printf \"...\" \"\$CURRENT_NAME\" \"Atuar Pay\"

PASSO 2: Contexto completo do bash -lc '...'
bash -lc '
  ...
  printf \"[INFO] ... de %s para %s.\\n\" \"\$CURRENT_NAME\" \"Atuar Pay\"
  ...
'

PASSO 3: run_quiet recebe e faz eval "$*"
eval "bash -lc '
  ...
  printf \"[INFO] ... de %s para %s.\\n\" \"\$CURRENT_NAME\" \"Atuar Pay\"
  ...
'"

PROBLEMA DETECTADO:
Quando "Atuar Pay" (com espa√ßo) √© inserido diretamente no c√≥digo,
as aspas \" ao redor dele est√£o DENTRO das aspas simples do bash -lc,
ent√£o s√£o tratadas como caracteres literais, n√£o como delimitadores.

Isso deveria funcionar... mas o eval complica as coisas!

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

TESTE SIMPLIFICADO:
Vamos verificar se o problema √© realmente com as aspas ou
se √© algo mais sutil relacionado ao eval...

ERRO:
${empresa} e ${nome_titulo} s√£o expandidos FORA do bash -lc,

M√©todo 1: Passar vari√°veis via vari√°veis de ambiente
------------------------------------------------------
run_quiet "..." "DB_NAME='${empresa}' TARGET_NAME='${nome_titulo}' bash -lc '
  ...usa \$DB_NAME e \$TARGET_NAME diretamente...
'"

M√©todo 2: Escapar $ para expans√£o interna
------------------------------------------
run_quiet "..." "bash -lc '
  DB_NAME=\"\${empresa}\"
  TARGET_NAME=\"\${nome_titulo}\"
  ...
'"

Mas precisa que 'empresa' e 'nome_titulo' existam no ambiente bash -lc,
o que N√ÉO √© o caso.

M√©todo 3: Evitar bash -lc e usar sudo direto (MELHOR)
------------------------------------------------------
run_quiet "..." "
  empresa='${empresa}'
  nome_titulo='${nome_titulo}'
  sudo -u postgres bash <<EOSQL
    ...c√≥digo SQL aqui...

O problema ocorria porque:
1. run_quiet recebe o comando como string entre aspas duplas
2. Dentro dessas aspas duplas, ${empresa} e ${nome_titulo} eram
   expandidos ANTES de bash -lc executar
3. Quando nome_titulo="Atuar Pay" (com espa√ßo), isso quebrava
   a sintaxe ao passar pelo eval dentro de run_quiet

Solu√ß√£o implementada:
1. Passar as vari√°veis como vari√°veis de ambiente para bash -lc
2. Dentro do bash -lc, usar \$empresa e \$nome_titulo
3. O backslash impede a expans√£o prematura pelo shell principal
4. As vari√°veis s√£o expandidas corretamente dentro do bash -lc

‚úÖ Verificado: N√£o h√° outras ocorr√™ncias do mesmo padr√£o problem√°tico

As outras linhas que usam ${empresa} ou ${nome_titulo} com bash -lc
est√£o corretas porque usam aspas duplas (n√£o aspas simples), ent√£o
a expans√£o das vari√°veis acontece de forma adequada.

PROBLEMA:
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
run_quiet usa: eval "$*"

Quando passamos: bash -lc '...conte√∫do com aspas...'
O eval recebe: "bash -lc '...conte√∫do com aspas...'"

As aspas duplas \" dentro do bash -lc s√£o interpretadas pelo EVAL
primeiro, n√£o pelo bash -lc. Isso quebra a sintaxe.

ERRO ESPEC√çFICO:
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
eval "bash -lc '
  printf \"[INFO] Nome...\"   ‚Üê EVAL interpreta as aspas duplas
  ...                          ‚Üê mas n√£o consegue fechar corretamente
'"                             ‚Üê gera "unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'"

SOLU√á√ÉO:
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
Usar HEREDOC em vez de bash -lc '...'

Isso evita o problema de aspas aninhadas dentro de eval.
