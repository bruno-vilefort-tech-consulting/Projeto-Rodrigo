fix(installer): remove frozen-lockfile to allow pnpm-lock regeneration

Changes:
- Remove --frozen-lockfile flag from pnpm install in backend deps step
- Simplify retry logic to always run `pnpm install` without flags on failure
- This allows pnpm to regenerate lock file with missing dependencies

Context:
- Package.json already contains all required dependencies (lodash, moment, 
  zod, mime, form-data, qs, bluebird and their @types)
- Previous frozen-lockfile prevented lock regeneration causing build failures
- Part of refactor/migrate-installer-patches migration (65%)

fix(installer): recognize Projeto-Rodrigo/chatia directory structure

Changes:
- Check for $tmpd/Projeto-Rodrigo/chatia before $tmpd/chatia
- Ensures installer finds code when cloning from GitHub repo
- Maintains backwards compatibility with other directory structures

Context:
- GitHub repo structure is /Projeto-Rodrigo/chatia/backend
- Previous logic only checked for /chatia/backend
- This caused installer to fail finding the updated package.json

fix(installer): clone specific GitHub branch with updated dependencies

Changes:
- Add GITHUB_BRANCH variable with default 'refactor/migrate-installer-patches'
- Use --branch and --single-branch flags in git clone
- Ensures installer clones the branch with updated package.json

Root Cause:
- Previous git clone defaulted to main/master branch
- Updated package.json with lodash, moment, zod, etc. is in refactor branch
- Installer was cloning old code without required dependencies

refactor: reorganize repo structure and update installer for main branch

Changes:
1. Repository structure:
   - Remove Projeto-Rodrigo/ prefix directory
   - Move chatia/ to root level
   - Simplified structure: /chatia/backend and /chatia/frontend

2. Installer updates:
   - Default branch changed to 'main' (from refactor/migrate-installer-patches)
   - Updated path logic to check /chatia first (removed Projeto-Rodrigo check)
   - Maintains backward compatibility with direct backend/frontend structure

3. All dependency fixes preserved:
   - lodash, moment, zod, mime, form-data, qs, bluebird in package.json
   - pnpm install without --frozen-lockfile
   - TypeScript compilation will work correctly

Structure now:
/chatia/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/ (with updated package.json)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ecosystem.config.js
